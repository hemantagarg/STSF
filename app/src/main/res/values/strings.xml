However, even an uninvited team member will be able to view the event since he is part of the team.\n\n<b>MeetUp</b>\nA meetup is team’s internal event. All team members are invited by default. However, organizer can deselect invitees before saving the event. Since it’s a team’s internal event, rest of the SF community cannot view or follow this event. But an organizer can invite a non team member by sending specific invites irrespective of whether he /she has a relevant sports Avatar.. In such a case, the event is visible to that specific non team member also.\n\n<b>Event</b>\nTeam’s public event involves each and everyone in the SF universe. SF members can decide to either attend or just follow updates of this event. This event allows organizer to invite anyone irrespective of whether SF member has a relevant sports avatar. As per the name, these events are visible to all on Teams general profile page, calendar and other public forums.
